## 🌅 Morning

| Status | Task |
|:------:|------|
| ❌ | Skipped morning routine |
| ⚠️ | This has been happening almost every day lately |

---

## 🧠 Afternoon & Evening

> [!NOTE] Major Win
> Spent the **entire afternoon and evening** setting up my **local TTS3 voice cloning model**
> - Took way longer than expected
> - ✅ Setup is finally **DONE**

---

## 🌙 Night (After Dinner)

### 🤖 Clawd Bot Setup

| Time | Activity |
|:----:|----------|
| ~10 PM | Set up **Clawd Bot** |
| 🔍 | Found out **Kimi 2.5 is free** |
| ❌ | Tried running it → hit **rate limit issues** |
| 💡 | Conclusion: setup is kinda fucked for now |

---

## 🔍 Key Observations

> [!TIP] Discovery
> **Kimi 2.5** seems to be **actually free** when used with an **NVIDIA API key**
> 
> The issue is likely not the model itself, but the current integration/limits

---

## 📌 Tomorrow's Mission

- [ ] Try integrating **Kimi 2.5 (NVIDIA API)** with **Clawd Bot**
- [ ] See if this avoids the rate limit problem
