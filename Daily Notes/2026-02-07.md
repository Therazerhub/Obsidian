# 📅 Daily Log — Today

## 🌅 Morning
- Skipped morning routine  
- This has been happening almost every day lately

## 🧠 Afternoon & Evening
- Spent the **entire afternoon and evening** setting up my **local TTS3 voice cloning model**
- Took way longer than expected, but setup is finally done

## 🌙 Night (After Dinner)
- Around **10 PM**, set up **Clawd Bot**
- Found out people are saying **Kimi 2.5 is free**
- Tried running it → hit **rate limit issues**
- Conclusion for now: setup is kinda fucked

## 🔍 Observations
- Kimi 2.5 seems to be **actually free when used with an NVIDIA API key**
- The issue is likely not the model itself, but the current integration / limits

## 📌 Plan for Tomorrow
- Try integrating **Kimi 2.5 (NVIDIA API)** with **Clawd Bot**
- See if this avoids the rate limit problem
