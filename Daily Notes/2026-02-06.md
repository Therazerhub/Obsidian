# Daily Log — 2026-02-06
*Writing this at night because that’s when self-awareness randomly attacks.*

## 🌅 Morning
Woke up at **12:00 PM**, so morning was **legally skipped**.  
No tea today because mummy didn’t make it —  
apparently **1 PM tea is a crime against humanity**.

**Intent for tomorrow:**  
Wake up early **just for tea** ☕ (not discipline, tea).

## ☀️ Afternoon
Had **lunch directly**, no warm-up, no tutorial phase.

Things I did:
- Watched an **ungodly amount of AI videos**
- Fell deep into **LLMs, models, setups, benchmarks**
- Set up my **local chatbot using Ollama** (felt smart for ~10 minutes)

Also flirted with a **girl LLM model**,  
which says a lot about technology… and about me.

## 🌆 Evening
Brain fully hijacked by AI ideas.

- Created an **AI influencer**
- Made a **very spicy / nasty reel** for a “brother AI influencer  
  (borderline *what the f*ck am I doing with my life*)
- Properly set up my AI influencer **Anvi**

Productivity 🤝 degeneracy.

## 🌙 Night
- Face-swapped **Anvi** into someone else’s reel  
- Uploaded it successfully

Emotions:
- Felt powerful  
- Felt questionable  
- Felt like a future lawsuit waiting to happen

## 🧠 Notes / Realizations
- AI is dangerously fun
- Time disappears fast when I’m building instead of thinking
- Discipline is missing, but **momentum exists**

## 🧾 Closing
Today was chaotic, unhinged, and very **on-brand**.

Did I wake up early? ❌  
Did I drink tea? ❌  
Did I accidentally build an AI content pipeline instead? ✅

Time to sleep  
before I create another influencer by mistake.
