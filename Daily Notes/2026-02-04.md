# Daily Log — 2026-02-05

## Morning
Woke up at **11:00 AM**.  
Did nothing productive for a while.

## Afternoon
Played **NFS Heat** and watched YouTube.  
Mostly stupid, time-wasting stuff till evening.

## Evening
Did some research on **Obsidian**.  
Realized I actually need to do *something* with my life.

## Reflection
Decided to start documenting my life in Obsidian and treat it like a **second brain**.  
The big graph feels motivating — makes me think I might actually have a big brain if I keep feeding it.

## Setup
Set up Obsidian and installed a few plugins.  
Honestly, it was pretty fun.

## Closing
Hopefully, I’ll write like this every day.
