## Summary
Late night planning session with Razer (1 AM). Big push to get AI infrastructure locked down before Kimi trial expires. Lots of documentation needs created.

## Tasks Created for Tomorrow (Feb 10)

### 🔧 AI Model Stack Setup
- [ ] Set up Google AI (Gemini/antigravity) free models
- [ ] Stack ALL free AI models before Kimi 7-day trial expires
- [ ] Research tiny LLMs (TinyLlama, etc.) for AWS cost reduction
- [ ] Document the free model stack

### 📱 Obsidian Setup
- [ ] Set up Obsidian Sync on iOS — see [[Obsidian iOS Sync Setup Guide]]
- [ ] Verify vault sync across devices

### 🤖 Agent Projects
- [ ] Create "Code Teacher" agent for Razer (doesn't know how to code yet)
- [ ] Build guide: [[Learn to Code with AI Agent Guide]]

### 🏠 Local OpenClaw Setup
- [ ] Research local OpenClaw deployment on main system
- [ ] Security hardening for local setup
- [ ] Document: [[Local OpenClaw Setup Guide]]

### 💰 Monetization
- [ ] Research ways to earn money with OpenClaw
- [ ] Document findings: [[OpenClaw Monetization Guide]]

### 📤 GitHub
- [ ] Push all documentation to GitHub when complete

## Resources to Create
1. [[Obsidian iOS Sync Setup Guide]] — Step-by-step for iPhone/iPad sync
2. [[Learn to Code with AI Agent Guide]] — Curriculum + agent prompts
3. [[Local OpenClaw Setup Guide]] — Local deployment + security
4. [[OpenClaw Monetization Guide]] — Money-making ideas

## Conversation Summary
Razer listed out all the things he wants to tackle. Priority is securing free AI access before trial expires. Wants to learn coding through an AI tutor (smart!). Also wants to run OpenClaw locally for privacy and find ways to monetize the setup. Ambitious but doable!

**Next Session:** Start with free model setup + create the linked guides.
