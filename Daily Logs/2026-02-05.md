# Daily Log — 2026-02-05  
*Started writing this at 12:12 AM because sleep schedule is a myth.*

## Morning  
Technically it was **afternoon** when I woke up at **12:00 PM**,  
so morning was **successfully skipped**.

## Afternoon  
Drank tea.  
Listened to songs.  
Did timepass while questioning the existence of my life.

Thought about learning **coding**,  
then immediately did **nothing** about it.

Ended up playing games and watching bullshit like a professional.

## Evening  
Did nothing productive here either.  

But I watched a really good **tech video** that inspired me and reignited a spark I’ve been missing for a long time.  
Now I just need to hold onto that spark, because my mind wanders faster than an idiot 2-year-old.

## Night / Realizations  
Finally accepted that I can’t keep living on autopilot.

- Decided to properly set up **Obsidian** and start documenting my life as a second brain  
- Planning to explore **Linux** more  
- Need to start **coding seriously**, at least begin instead of overthinking  
- The big graph view in Obsidian is weirdly motivating — makes me feel like I might actually have a big brain

## Tomorrow (6 Feb – If I don’t sabotage myself)
- Make and upload a **motivational anime video** (script already ready)  
- Upload it on a **different YouTube channel**  
- Drop the **Voidex** name — sounds cool but feels like bullshit now  
- Come up with a **simple, clean channel name**  
- Do *something* with coding, even if it’s small

## Closing  
Today was mostly chaos, but at least I’m **aware** now.  
That’s better than nothing.
